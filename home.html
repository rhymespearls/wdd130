    <p> Hello people! My name is Jeremiah. This is my first semester here in BYUI and I'm pursuing Electrical Engineering with concentration in control systems. Since high school, swimming and playing socccer have been some of my favorite things to do.</p>
    <p>I work in the hinckley building as a custodian, and that has helped me to wake up on time and be punctual as well. Again, one of the things that I love about this college is the professors. They freaking awesome! </p>
    <P>I chose to study WDD becuase I love the concept about how websites are been created and I'm willing to know more about it. With all said and done, I'm eternally grateful to be a member of the Church Of Jesus Christ Of Later-Day Saints for a little over two decades now.</P>
