    <section>
<P>Hello people! My name is Jeremiah. This is my first semester here in BYUI and I’m pursuing Electrical Engineering with a concentration in control systems.</p> 
<p>Since high school, swimming and playing soccer have been some of my favorite things to do. It breaks my heart knowing that I’m single, but I will continue to shine my eyes to an immeasurable degree to see if I could spot a pretty lady to hangout with. LOL!</p>
    <p>I work in the hinckley building as a custodian, and that has helped me <br> to wake up on time and be punctual as well. </p>
    </section>
    
<P style= 'color:brown ;'> Again, one of the things I love about this college is the professors. They are freaking awesome! I chose to study WDD because I love the concept about how websites are been created and I’m willing to know  more about it.</P> 
<p>With all said and done, I’m eternally grateful to be a member of the Church Of Jesus Christ Of Latter-Day Saints for a little over two decades now. I also had the opportunity to serve a full time mission for this great institution.</p>
