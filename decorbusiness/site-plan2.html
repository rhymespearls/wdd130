      </h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Noto Sans  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>when text is rendered by a computer, sometimes there will be characters in the text that can not be displayed,
        because no font that supports them is available to the computer. When this occurs, small boxes are
        shown to represent the characters. This is the Sans Latin, Greek and Cyrillic family. It has Regular, Bold,
        Italic and Bold Italic styles and is hinted. It is derived from Droid, and like Droid it has a serif sister family, 
        Noto Serif.</p>
      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Open Sans  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p> Open Sans was designed with an upright stress, open forms and a neutral,
        yet friendly appearance. It was optimized for print, web, and mobile interfaces, and has excellent legibility 
        characteristics in its letterforms. Open Sans is a humanist sans serif typeface designed by Steve Matteson, 
        Type Director of Ascender Corp.</p>
